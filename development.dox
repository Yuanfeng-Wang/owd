      <td><b>breakaway positions</b> publish breakaway detection
          settings for the three fingers.  Requires querying
          additional finger puck parameters.</td>

Additional unscheduled tasks:
  <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3">
    <tr>
      <th width="120" align="left">Date</th>
      <th width="120" align="left">Assigned to</th>
      <th align="left">Description and estimate</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td><b>auto-calibration</b> Determine startup calibration for
          J5/J6/J7 automatically by moving the joints to their limits
          in a safe way.  Requires resurrecting code that Mike had
          working on the previous Herb configuration.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      <td><b>transmission ratio parameterization</b> Allow the
          transmission ratios to be set via ROS parameters or from a file
          so that they can be calibrated for each individual WAM.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      <td><b>absolute joint encoders</b> [3 days] Switch over to using the
          joint encoders to avoid calibration and achieve better
          endpoint accuracy.  Requires getting additional puck values
          and tuning the control gains based on new error scales.
          Also need to see whether it's necessary to use the motor
          encoders for interpolation in between joint encoder
          ticks.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      <td><b>calibration verification (possibly using F/T sensor)</b>
          Verify the overall arm joint angles by moving joints to
          their limits and/or watching the F/T sensor values as the
          hand moves around.  This could be done as a subroutine in
          openwamdriver.cpp.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      <td><b>update dynamic model based on finger positions</b> The
          link7 model assumes the CG of the hand is always on-axis,
          without regard for the finger positions.  Most of the
          groundwork is in place for the link7 model to update based
          on the actual finger positions, but it still needs final
          testing.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      <td><b>calibrate dynamic model</b> write a system-ID routine to
          improve the inertial parameters of each link.  This could be
          done outside of OWD, either online or offline.  Currently
          we're just using data calculated from the CAD mass
          models.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>

      <td><b>recalibration of transmission ratios</b> Automatically
          check for and adjust the transmission ratios for each joint.
          Similar work to the joint offset auto-calibration.</td>

    </tr>
